    <p>Workplace diversity is taking the HR world by storm.
	 More than ever, employers are prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) 
	 initiatives and investing resources into making sure their teams are set up for success.
	 Focusing on DEI is not only the smart thing to do for your business but also the right thing to do as a human, for humanity.</p>

    <p>Put very simply, diversity in the workplace means that a company hires a wide range of diverse individuals. 
	Diversity is often misconceived as solely multicultural matters, however it also applies to diversity of gender, 
	race, ethnicity, age, sexuality, language, educational, background, and so on. Not only that it also means to make sure 
	that the participation of these employees is equal.</p>
    <p>A company with workplace diversity is the company who has employees with a wide range of characteristics and experiences.
	Therefore in recent years, the topic of diversity and inclusion in the workplace has extended to ensuring that companies 
	increasing the participation, performance and compensation of minorities, not just symbolic hiring in order to 'tick a box'.</p>
